    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. Classes are used to define new types of objects. A class is a blueprint for an object. It defines a set of *attributes* and *methods* that an object of the class will have. An *attribute* is a variable that is associated with the class. A *method* is a function that is associated with the class. Using classes, we can create new instances of objects that have the same attributes and methods as the class."
