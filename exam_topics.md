This is a list of examples of topics that were not covered in the course. A possibility for the exam is to choose one of these topics, explore them in detail as we did for the topics covered in the course, and present them during the exam. 

Suggestions by the students not present in this list are welcome.

**N.B.**: In any case, we should agree on the topic before deciding for the exam.
